## Technical Highlights

- **React 19 Features**: Implemented new React 19 features in state management
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation throughout the project
- **API Integration**: Using jsonplaceholder for mock data
- **Form Validation**: Basic validation implemented (could be improved)
- **Testing**: Basic test coverage implemented

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Validation**: Form validation could be more robust
2. **TypeScript**: Some types could be more strictly defined
3. **ESLint Rules**: Could benefit from stricter ESLint configuration
4. **Testing**: Test coverage could be expanded

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
