  - [View commit details](https://github.com/szmeku/g-assignment/commit/a099269149eb8a62b260c8d800e28e9f2a631a14)
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation throughout the project
- **API Integration**: Using jsonplaceholder for mock data
- **Form Validation**: Basic validation implemented (could be improved)
- **Testing**: Basic test example for edit form

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Validation**: Just basic validation implemented
2. **TypeScript**: Some types could be more strictly defined
3. **ESLint Rules**: Could benefit from stricter ESLint configuration
4. **Testing**: Test coverage could be expanded
